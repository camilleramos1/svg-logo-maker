## Description
In this SVG logo maker, I used JavaScript to create a generator that creates an SVG logo based off of user input. The user is asked 4 questions, and once those questions have been answered, an SVG logo is created for them under the file name "logo.svg". 

## Installation
User must clone this repo, as well as use NodeJs to run the index.js file in their terminal. This application uses the dependencies inquirer and jest. 

## Usage
First, run the index.js file in Nodejs in your local terminal. Answer the 4 questions. Once answered, a file will be created named "logo.svg" that contains the SVG creation based off of user's input.
